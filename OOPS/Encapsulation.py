Problem Statement:
Create a class BankAccount with:

A private attribute __balance initialized to 0

Public methods:

deposit(amount)

withdraw(amount)

get_balance() (returns balance)

Make sure negative balances arenâ€™t allowed.

Expected Output:

acc = BankAccount()
acc.deposit(1000)
print(acc.get_balance())    # 1000
acc.withdraw(500)
print(acc.get_balance())    # 500
acc.withdraw(1000)          # Insufficient balance

Deposited: 1000
Balance: 1000
Withdrew: 500
Balance: 500
Insufficient balance!
